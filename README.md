## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Flutter, Dart, Java/Kotlin
- **Data Retrieval:** SOAP APIs, XML parsing
- **Components:**  Sizer,GetX, etc.

## Implementation Considerations

- **API Calls:** The app efficiently fetches data using API calls, enhancing performance and data retrieval. Within Flutter, the UI and state management follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, ensuring effective data flow and rendering for a responsive user interface.

- **Scalability:** The app ensures scalability by employing pagination or lazy loading mechanisms, allowing the retrieval of large volumes of list . This approach maintains app performance and responsiveness, even with extensive data sets.

- **Error Handling:** A robust error handling system is integrated to proficiently manage various scenarios, including network disruptions, server-side issues, or data inconsistencies. Clear and user-friendly error messages are displayed, facilitating better comprehension and user experience.


## App Design Decisions

- **UI/UX Design:** The design focuses on intuitive navigation, minimalist UI elements, and responsiveness across various screen sizes and orientations.

- **Architecture:** The app follows a clean architecture pattern MVC, separating concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability.

- **Third-party Libraries:** Notable third-party libraries like Dio for network requests and GetX for state management are used, enhancing the app's functionality and performance.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimization:** Data caching, minimal network calls, and efficient rendering techniques are employed to optimize performance and reduce app loading times.
